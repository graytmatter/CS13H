TRAVELLING SALESMAN
This is a fairly hacky solution to the classic travelling salesman problem: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?

I have several unenssisary global variables and the way I pass parameters through the main find-hamiltonian/dfs is really not ideal and leads to O(n^2) space complexity. But it does work!
